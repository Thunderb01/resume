PROJECT EXPERIENCE

Gitlet
•	Developed a version control system in Java that mimics the basic features of Git
•	Implemented serialization to store file versions and different version branches
•	Enabled ability to organize files better and in a more linear version offline without Git

Parallel Processing and Optimization
•	Developed and optimized parallel algorithms and utilized multi-core processors and parallel computing frameworks
•	Designed and implemented a parallel processing solution for complex problem solving, significantly improving computational efficiency of computing arithmetic expressions

Neural Networks
•	Designed and implemented a deep neural network model for image classification, achieving an accuracy of over 95% on a challenging dataset. 
•	The model consisted of multiple convolutional and fully connected layers, and fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
